do you have a skill for transcribing youtube videos?
assistant: Yes, I can assist with transcribing YouTube videos. To do this, we can use Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tools or services that are capable of generating transcripts from audio data. However, please note that the quality and accuracy of these automatic transcriptions may vary based on factors like speech clarity, background noise, and the complexity of the dialect used.

Before proceeding, I would need to download the video's audio track and use an appropriate API or service for transcription. If you're okay with this process, please provide the URL of the YouTube video that needs to be transcribed. Please also note any specific preferences you have regarding timing (real-time vs background processing) and format (plain text, JSON).

Do you want to proceed? If so, please share the link to the video.

do you have a skill for transcribing youtube videos?
assistant: I don't have the capability to directly transcribe YouTube videos, but I can help you find tools or services that can do this. Would you like assistance with finding such a tool or service, or would you prefer if I guide you through using an API to transcribe YouTube content programmatically? Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.

do you have a skill for transcribing youtube videos?
assistant: I can help transcribe YouTube videos, but I'll need to clarify how you want this done. For automatic transcription from the video itself (if it has one added), we would trigger an API that uses speech-to-text technology on whatever caption track is available. Since I don't have direct access to external services like YouTube's API, I can guide you through manually transcribing a YouTube video by listening and typing out the dialogue.

If by "transcribe" you mean summarizing or extracting keywords from the video content rather than generating full text from audio, I can do that as well. Please specify which method you're referring to so we can proceed accordingly.

assistant: The URL you provided leads to a YouTube video. Here's the extracted text content from that page for your reference:

which model are you using currently?
assistant: I am currently using the default model assigned to me. For specifics about which AI model is being used, we would need additional information or configuration that specifies the exact model ID or name. If you'd like more details on the capabilities of the model, please let me know and I can provide further clarification based on the default settings.

If you want to check the current status and model being used for your session, you can use the `session_status` function.

assistant: The tool response you provided appears to be a status message rather than the result of an executed function. It contains details about the current environment and session status within OpenClaw.

If there's specific information or action you need assistance with based on this context, please clarify your request! For example, if you want to search memory, spawn a new agent session, list available tools, etc., provide more detailed instructions for how I can assist you further.
