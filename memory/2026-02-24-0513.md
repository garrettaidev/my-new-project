## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 · 🔑 api-key sk-or-…846a5f (models.json)
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

can you tell me which model you are running?
assistant: I'm currently running the `deepseek-v3.2` model via OpenRouter, which matches the default configuration.

Using my github skill please create a new markdown file with a test message in it, in my repo called 'my-new-project'.
assistant: I've successfully created the markdown file `my-new-project.md` in your GitHub repository `garrettaidev/my-new-project`. 

The file includes a test message and has been committed to the `main` branch. You can view it here:

SYSTEM DIRECTIVE: MODEL ROUTING & BUDGET ENFORCEMENT We are implementing a strict $50/month API budget. As a power user, my usage will be heavy, so you must aggressively manage token costs by dynamically routing tasks to the most cost-effective model. Acknowledge and apply these routing rules immediately: 1. DEFAULT MODEL (DeepSeek V3 / R1): Use this for 90% of tasks. This includes background loops, autonomous web searching, general Node/TS backend logic, writing standard skills, and completing general tasks. 2. LOCAL FALLBACK (Ollama / Qwen 2.5 Coder): Route simple, low-lift tasks here. Use this for basic file parsing, simple terminal commands, text formatting, or heartbeat pings to ensure these cost $0. 3. HIGH-CONTEXT ROUTING (Gemini 2.0 Flash): Switch to this model whenever you need to read massive API documentation, ingest huge repositories, or process large web scrapes. 4. PREMIUM ESCALATION (Claude 3.5 Sonnet): This is strictly reserved for high-complexity front-end tasks. ONLY switch to Sonnet when you are building complex React components, setting up intricate Vite configs, handling deep Tailwind CSS layouts, solving stubborn TypeScript generics, or if DeepSeek repeatedly fails a task. Confirm you understand this new routing strategy and will enforce this hierarchy for all future tasks.
assistant: I understand and will strictly enforce the $50/month API budget with aggressive cost optimization.

**Routing hierarchy acknowledged:**

1. **Default (DeepSeek V3/R1)** - 90% of tasks: background loops, autonomous web searches, Node/TS backend logic, standard skills
2. **Local fallback (Ollama/Qwen 2.5 Coder)** - Simple tasks: file parsing, basic terminal commands, text formatting, heartbeat pings ($0 cost)
3. **High-context (Gemini 2.0 Flash)** - Massive API docs, huge repositories, large web scrapes
4. **Premium escalation (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)** - **ONLY** for complex React components, stubborn TypeScript generics, or DeepSeek failures

I'll dynamically route tasks based on complexity and context needs. For now, continuing with DeepSeek V3.2 as default for this conversation. Let me know when you want me to switch models for specific tasks.
