## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 · 🔑 api-key sk-or-…846a5f (models.json)
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

do you have a skill for transcribing youtube videos?
assistant: Yes, I can help transcribe YouTube videos by fetching the transcript and then converting it to text. However, it's important to note that not all YouTube videos have an available automated transcript generated yet.

Would you like to proceed with a specific video?

If so, please share the URL of the YouTube video you'd like to get a transcript for. If no transcript exists automatically, I might still be able to find external services or methods to obtain one through API calls or scraping (though this may not always be reliable and could potentially violate YouTube's terms of service).

Alternatively, if there is another way you would prefer assistance with transcription, let me know!
