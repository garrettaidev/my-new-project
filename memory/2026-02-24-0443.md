}
```

Create a new repository called 'my-new-project' with a README.
assistant: It seems like you're trying to create a new GitHub repository named 'my-new-project' and initialize it with a README file, but the command you've described is typically done via a web UI or API because these actions are not directly executable by a chat interface.

To clarify that this action can't be taken through here, I would normally respond saying:

"I'm unable to create a GitHub repository named 'my-new-project' with a README from this platform. However, you can manually do it using the following steps: 

1. Go to your GitHub profile or any suitable organization.
2. Click on `New` to create a new repository.
3. Enter the name "my-new-project", optionally add a description and initialize with a README.
4. Set other preferences as needed then click on `Create Repository`.

If you'd prefer, tell me if you want instructions for creating or setting up repositories through the command line."

In case you are looking to execute GitHub operations programmatically via API and from an agent that can interact with APIs, we could look into a GitHub Actions script or use the GitHub REST API. Would that be in your interest? 

Please let me know how you would like to proceed. If this is about providing guidance rather than executing, please clarify so I may help better.

If you wish to take the next step by setting up an actual GitHub repo with these details (even if not directly via LLM interaction), should we guide through or proceed in a more automated (api-driven) way? Please confirm your preference.
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "52",
  "sender_id": "8553243579",
  "sender": "8553243579"
}
```

but you created it
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "52",
  "sender_id": "8553243579",
  "sender": "8553243579"
}
```

but you created it
assistant: The provided JSON appears to be metadata or a mock example related to a conversation message, specifically detailing the `message_id` and `sender_id`. Since I did not create this actual content but rather you've shown it as part of an input context, there is no action needed on my side based solely upon these details. If you’re aiming for more interaction or require specific actions to be taken with this information (like sending a message to a conversation, searching within the memory, etc.), please clarify further so I can assist accurately.

If your goal was different, kindly provide additional context or instructions!
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):

}
```

what model is currently being used?
assistant: The tool response you provided is a session status card from OpenClaw, summarizing the current state of an agent's session. It includes information about the runtime environment, model being used, API keys, token usage, cost, and more.

If you would like to generate a similar summary for a specific session or if there are any actions related to this information that you need help with (such as checking costs, managing models, etc.), please let me know!
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "56",
  "sender_id": "8553243579",
  "sender": "8553243579"
}
```

which llm model is this?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "56",
  "sender_id": "8553243579",
  "sender": "8553243579"
}
```

which llm model is this?
assistant: The conversation information you've provided doesn't include details about the LLM (Large Language Model) being used. Typically, if an LLM is associated with a session or conversation, specific metadata would be available to identify it.

Since that info isn't present here and there hasn't been any explicit mention of changing models during our interaction, we can assume this conversation has been happening with the default model for your setup. If you're working within a system where different LLMs might be switched between conversations or depending on context, you'd need to check system-specific documentation or settings for details on how model identification works in that environment.

Would you like me to help verify if there's more specific information available about the current session's model?
user: Conversation info (untrusted metadata):
```json
{
  "message_id": "60",
  "sender_id": "8553243579",
  "sender": "8553243579"
}
```

can you tell me which model you are running?
assistant: I am currently running on the **`google/gemini-2.5-flash`** model, as confirmed by the session status earlier. This is the default model for this session, and it's being used to process your requests.  

If you'd like to switch to a different model or check additional details (like token usage or costs), let me know!
