## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 · 🔑 api-key sk-or-…846a5f (models.json)
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

```

can you tell me what your current model is and which you are to use as fallbacks?
assistant: I'm currently running on **deepseek-v3.2** (`openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2`). That's also set as my default primary model.

If it ever becomes unavailable, my configured fallbacks are:
- **gemini** (`google/gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **qwen** (`ollama/qwen2.5:14b`)

The aliases `deepseek`, `gemini`, `qwen`, and `sonnet` are available for quick model switches when needed.

I need the transcript from a youtube video. Can you write me a skill to get the transcript of the video and save it as a markdown file in my github repo?
assistant: I've created a YouTube transcript fetching skill for you. It's now ready in your workspace.

## What's in the skill

**`skills/public/youtube-transcript/`**
- `SKILL.md` - Full documentation with installation, usage, and GitHub integration
- `scripts/fetch_transcript.py` - Python script that does the actual work

**Packaged skill file:** `youtube-transcript.skill` (in workspace root) - ready for distribution

## How it works

The skill uses the `youtube-transcript-api` Python library to:
1. Extract video IDs from various YouTube URL formats
2. Fetch available transcripts (including auto-generated captions)
3. Format them as markdown with optional timestamps
4. Save to a file with metadata header

## Quick start

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install youtube-transcript-api
```

### 2. Basic usage
```bash
python skills/public/youtube-transcript/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```
Creates `VIDEO_ID.md` in current directory.

### 3. Save to your GitHub repo
```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
python /path/to/skill/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "YOUTUBE_URL" docs/transcript.md
git add docs/transcript.md
git commit -m "Add YouTube transcript"
git push
```

## Example output
```markdown
# YouTube Transcript: VIDEO_ID
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID

## Transcript
[00:00] Hello and welcome to this tutorial.
[00:05] Today we'll be learning about Python scripts.
...
```

## Using with OpenClaw

When you ask about YouTube transcripts, OpenClaw will automatically trigger this skill. You can also:

1. Check if dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   python -c "import youtube_transcript_api"
   ```

2. Run the script directly via `exec`:
   ```bash
   python skills/public/youtube-transcript/scripts/fetch_transcript.py "YOUR_URL"
   ```

## Notes
- Some videos have transcripts disabled or only auto-generated captions in specific languages
- The script includes error handling for these cases
- Timestamps are included by default in `[MM:SS]` format

The skill is already in your workspace's `skills/public/` directory and ready to use. Want to test it with a specific YouTube video?
