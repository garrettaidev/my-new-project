## Conversation Summary

assistant: I have converted your text to speech. Here's the audio file:

you returned me a 6 second mp3 file. I asked you specifically to find a way to get the captions/transcripts from the youtube video and return it as markdown text
assistant: It seems like there was a misunderstanding in the previous request. To provide subtitles or transcripts in Markdown format, we need to first ensure that YouTube has those available for the specific video. Let's start by fetching the captions if they are available and then convert them into Markdown format.

I will proceed with this approach now.

Explain to me how obsidian works
assistant: Obsidian is a powerful, yet versatile note-taking and knowledge management application designed for desktops. Here are the key aspects of Obsidian:

1. **Note Storage**: It stores your notes as plain text files on your local file system (like Markdown `.md` files). This gives you full control over your data and versioning with tools like Git if desired.

2. **Linking Notes**: A unique feature is its ability to create bi-directional links between notes, which are similar to hyperlinks but more flexible and deeply integrated into Obsidian's features such as the Graph view and Daily Notes. You can also use backlinks to see all pages that link to a specific page.

3. **Vaults**: Your collection of related notes is called a vault. Vaults can contain sub-vaults, allowing for hierarchical organization.

4. **Plugins**: Extensibility is at the core of Obsidian with its vibrant ecosystem of plugins; from basic note linking helpers to complex knowledge management flows.

5. **Graph View**: Provides an interactive map view of your notes and their interconnected relationships as nodes and links, offering visual insights into how pieces of information connect within a vault.

6. **Daily Notes**: Automates the creation and linking of new daily files for journaling or task management purposes.
   
7. **Catalyst**: Allows you to extend the functionality with custom code to fit your workflow needs exactly as you want them.
   
8. **Community Contribution**: There’s an active community that continuously contributes both plugins and integrations, making Obsidian a tool that evolves based on user feedback.

In summary, Obsidian enhances standard note-taking through powerful linking capabilities, extensible plugin architecture, automatic organization features such as Daily Notes, as well as visual mappings of your content network in the Graph view. With these capabilities, Obsidian provides an efficient space for managing thoughts and information.

Is minimax a better llm model than deepseek?
assistant: To compare "minimax" and "deepseek," we need to clarify which models you're referring to, as these terms could correspond to different entities or might be specific to certain contexts. As of my last update:

- **Minimax**: This term is often associated with game theory and algorithms in computer science rather than language model names.
  
- **DeepSeek**: I couldn't find any widely recognized language model explicitly named "DeepSeek." There are, however, various models and research projects that may match parts of this name or concept. 

Given the lack of specific context about these terms being used as names for large language models (LLMs), you might be referring to a specific project or a hypothetical model. For comparing LLMs like GPT-3/4, Claude, Bard, etc., it's crucial to specify exact names and versions.

If "minimax" or "deepseek" are proprietary or newer research models, checking their documentation or publications for performance metrics would be necessary.

Let me know if you're referring to specific models by these names—providing more details will allow for a better comparison. If this is about a general assessment of model capabilities based on hypothetical scenarios, please specify which aspects (e.g., accuracy, speed, context understanding) you’d like compared.

assistant: It looks like you're trying to use the web_search tool but are missing a Brave Search API key. To proceed, you need to either run `openclaw configure --section web` and follow the prompts to store your API key or manually set the environment variable `BRAVE_API_KEY` in your Gateway setup.

Would you like to go ahead with configuring it now? If so, I can guide you through the process.

}
```

do I need to use brave?
assistant: No, you don't have to use Brave specifically. The tools available include a web search function that uses the Brave Search API, but if you'd prefer or if there's another reason you can't or don't want to use Brave, we can certainly explore other options such as using a different search engine API or method.

Do you need help with a specific kind of information lookup or task? If so, let me know what you're looking for and I'll assist accordingly.

hi, can you tell me which model you are currently running?
assistant: The tool response provided seems to be the status information rather than a direct function call. However, based on this information, it appears that we are working within an OpenClaw environment using the model `ollama/qwen2.5:14b`. The session details indicate it's interactively running with certain context usage and costs noted.

If you need to perform any specific action or tool function call using these tools (such as searching the web, fetching a URL content, analyzing an image, etc.), please provide additional instructions or parameters so that I can format them into the correct JSON object for a function call. For now, here's how an example API call might look based on your environment:

Example of calling `web_search`:
```json
{
  "name": "web_search",
  "arguments": {
    "query": "best pizza in san francisco"
  }
}
```

If you meant to do something specific with this context, please clarify.
