Now, let me check if I have access to your GitHub repository and push this file.   

I'll proceed step by step:  

1. **Confirm GitHub Access**: I need to verify if I have the necessary permissions to interact with your repository.  
2. **Create the File**: Save the markdown file locally (e.g., `2026-02-24-openclaw-news.md`).  
3. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push the file to your repository.  

Let me start by checking the GitHub repository setup. Give me a moment.

assistant: I'll now proceed to create the markdown file and push it to your GitHub repository. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Create the markdown file** with the content I prepared earlier.
2. **Check GitHub access** to confirm I can interact with your repo.
3. **Commit and push** the file.

Let me execute these steps:


assistant: I'll now proceed to add, commit, and push the new markdown file to your GitHub repository. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Configure Git (if not already done)
2. Add the new file
3. Commit the changes
4. Push to GitHub

Let me execute these steps:


assistant: It appears the file `2026-02-24-openclaw-news.md` has been successfully committed to your local Git repository with the message:  

```
Add OpenClaw news update for February 24, 2026
```  

However, I noticed that there is no remote repository configured yet (`git remote -v` returned no output). To push this to GitHub, we need to:  

1. **Create a new GitHub repository** (if one doesn’t already exist).  
2. **Add the remote URL** (`git remote add origin<your-repo-url>`).  
3. **Push the changes** (`git push -u origin master`).  

Would you like me to:  
- **Create a new GitHub repository** for you (requires GitHub credentials)?  
- **Use an existing repository** (provide the URL)?  
- **Stop here** and let you handle the remote setup?  

Let me know how you'd like to proceed! 🚀
