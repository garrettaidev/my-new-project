## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2 · 🔑 api-key sk-or-…846a5f (models.json)
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

do you have a skill for transcribing youtube videos?
assistant: I don't have a dedicated YouTube transcription skill, but I can help you transcribe videos using other tools. I can:

1. **Download audio** (if `yt-dlp` is available or installable)
2. **Extract existing captions** from YouTube (if the video has them)
3. **Use speech‑to‑text** via local tools or external APIs

Do you have a specific video URL you want transcribed? If so, I’ll check what’s feasible with the tools I have access to.
